<h3>text2JSON</h3>

<p>
The single command line argument is the path to a text file of the format
exported by clicking on the 'Save Text' button on http://syssci.renci.org/sort/.
The result is another file with the same path except with the extension '.json'
that contains a JSON object equivalent to what you would have gotten if you'd
clicked on the 'Save JSON' button. See
https://github.com/steve9000gi/sort for details.
